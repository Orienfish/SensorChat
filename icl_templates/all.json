        "Question": "How much total time did I spend eating on Thursday?",
        "Solution": "Query the database with the function <<calculate_duration>> using activity ((eating)) and date [[Thursday]].",
        "Explanation": "The question asks for the total duration, thus we can query the database with the function <<calculate_duration>> to obtain the total duration. The question specifically asks for the total duration of ((eating)), thus we can query the function <<calculate_duration>> using activity ((eating)). The question also asks for the total duration on [[Thursday]], thus we can query the function <<calculate_duration>> using the date [[Thursday]]."

        "Question": "What time do I get home in the afternoon on 2015-09-16 Wednesday?",
        "Solution": "Query the database with the function <<detect_first_time>> using activity ((at home), date [[2015-09-16 Wednesday]] and time of day ||afternoon||.",
        "Explanation": "The question asks for the concrete start time, thus we can query the database with the function <<detect_first_time>> to obtain the first time that the user did some activity. The question specifically asks for the first time of going back to home, thus we can query the function <<detect_first_time>> using activity ((at home)). The question also asks for the concrete start time on [[2015-09-16 Wednesday]] and in the ||afternoon||, thus we can query the function <<detect_first_time>> using the date [[2015-09-16 Wednesday]] and in the ||afternoon|| time of the day."

        "Solution": "Query the database with the function <<calculate_frequency>> using activity ((in class)) and date [[Wednesday]].",
        "Explanation": "The question asks for the frequency of activities, thus we can query the database with the function <<calculate_frequency>>. The question specifically asks for the frequency of ((in class)), thus we can query the function <<calculate_frequency>> using activity ((in class)). The question also asks for the activity frequency on [[Wednesday]], thus we can query the function <<calculate_frequency>> using the date [[Wednesday]]."

        "Explanation": "The question asks for the existence, thus we can query the database with the function <<calculate_duration>>. The question specifically asks for the existence of ((doing lab work)), thus we can query the function <<calculate_duration>> using activity ((doing lab work)). The question also asks for the activity frequency on [[Monday]], thus we can query the function <<calculate_duration>> using the date [[Monday]]."
