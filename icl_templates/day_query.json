        "Explanation": "The question asks for a concrete day that the user spends the most time in school, thus we need to query the duration of all days in the database. We can query the database with the function <<calculate_duration>> to obtain the total duration on each day. The question specifically asks for the total duration of ((in school)), thus we can query the function <<calculate_duration>> using activity ((in school)). To obtain the total duration on all days, we can query the function <<calculate_duration>> using the date [[all days]]."
